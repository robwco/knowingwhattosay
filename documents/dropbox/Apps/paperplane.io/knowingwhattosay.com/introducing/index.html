<p>Have you ever not known what to call something? </p>

<p>I always thought naming something was the hardest thing about of web design but recently I realized something. It&#39;s <strong>most</strong> of what designing for the web is. The stuff you build gets built <em>because</em> you to know what to say / write. This applies to stuff like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing website copy</li>
<li>Sending emails</li>
<li>Designing graphics like buttons</li>
<li>Coding sites and apps</li>
<li>Writing books</li>
<li>Naming products</li>
</ul>

<p>What separates the bad from the great isn&#39;t great graphics or an intuitive UI. That stuff helps but what matters is what&#39;s written. That informs everything. </p>

<p>It all comes back to the content and knowing what to say.</p>

<p>Why? Because design is about words. Most of what we do is about shaping words. That&#39;s the biggest element on the web. Most online businesses seem to forget and/or ignore it. </p>
