# Jekyll Responsive

This is just a quick set of CSS styles and slight markup changes from the [default Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) markup and styles. There are a couple minor tweaks to make the layout fluid, and two very small media queries to account for mobile devices.

I picked a couple of free Google Fonts that I thought looked nice, but of course feel free to pick whatever you like.

You can [see it action here](http://dankim.org).

Thanks, and enjoy!
