Business is hard. Businesses need customers. Freelancers need clients. Businesses hire freelancers to get them more customers or to make a problem go away. 

This isn't necessarily something the business can't do on it's own. Instead, it's something that the business doesn't want to invest resources in doing it alone. When paying a freelancer to do something costs less than doing it alone, hiring a freelancer is a good investment. 

But the business can't know that until cost is established. 

That's why hiring a freelancer is a weird proposition. A business typically knows their domain well. Hiring a freelancer though, that's not it's domain. That's outside of it's  expertise. 

If a business goes to job boards, it's met with a blank form that says "fill this out", something that's tough to do when you don't know what you need. In that case, most businesses reach out to their network for a referral. 

Still, they're eventually met with a freelancer asking "what do you want?" Sometimes the freelancer links to a form. 

As someone who's hired a handful of freelancers in the past year, I no longer look for this scenario. I look for something else now. I look to buy stuff the same way people have been buying stuff for thousands of years.

I look to buy products.  

Why? I understand how products are priced. I get to see it. 

I bought Draft Revise Express and Drip Concierge this way and the thing I loved about it was I was able to see exactly what I was getting before I decided to purchase it.

It made it easier to say yes because I was no longer being forced to pay for a black box of value. Instead of hiring a freelancer that says "I'll make all of your wildest dreams come true." I hired a product that said, "I'm this."

Sure, another freelancer might be able to do more for me than these products for less money, but how the fuck would I know that. It's 2015 and it's simply not worth the time it takes for me to find that out.

My business isn't about paying freelancers in hopes that they might help me some day. It's about making me money. It's about mitigating risk in investments that will make me more money. Just like every other company. Your consultancy business too.

For examples, you don't do spec work. So why should a client hire a freelancer without a firm guarantee of what they're getting. How is that fair?

You might be thinking, "Well proposing a solution takes time from the freelancer and they're not getting anything for it. Proposing a solution is basically spec work." This is true. 

Freelancers shouldn't do this either, if they hope to have a sound consultancy. The answer lies in a solution that's been used for thousands of years.

Creating a product. 

Productized services have been sweeping the web. The freelancer gives the business what it needs to make a sound investment (namely a price, a set scope of work, and an outcome) without having to create it from scratch for every client.

Instead the business plays on your terms, not the other way around.

It's something I've been on the receiving end of as a client. I truly prefer working this way. 

In fact, when I needed help on a specific project recently, I actively seeked out a productized service. That's how I found Drip Concierge by Philip Morgan.

The only problem was finding the product was tough for me. I know I'm a lot better connect than the average business so I decided to make something.
