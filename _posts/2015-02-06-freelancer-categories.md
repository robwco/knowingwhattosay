By far, the number one request that I get for Workshop is members want a personalized, "tailored-to-me" list of opportunities that is relevant to them and nobody else. It makes total sense. [The high quality (and free) Workshop-exclusive leads](http://letsworkshop.com/connect) I find are usually great at this.

But besides spending 5+ hours on each individual member my only other option to make this happen is creating categories that each lead can fall under.

This may sound like a mundane task but I saw it as an opportunity to re-think how freelancers categorize their services. The end result is something that I hope will focus more on selling a benefit of a service than just a service. It won't be anything like freelancer.com's category list:

**Freelancer.com's list:**

Why? Because this list is completely ridiculous.

I have no clue what most of the terms listed on Freelancer.com even mean. It's hard enough to understand design and development jargon when you're familiar with it (like user experience design), if you're completely unfamiliar, like a client, you stand no chance.

Worst of all, a person looking to hire a freelance consultant just doesn't care. That's why we don't bother to learn what they mean. Good freelance shops aren't commodities. A list of categories that focus on things like what language they code in are focused on the wrong thing. 

People are looking to pay for an outcome. They want results. Any list of categories that ignores these results is arbitrary and will do you a disservice if you use it.

When I look for a gig that can go on Workshop I'm not just looking for people who say they need freelancers. It's great if they do but I'm also looking for people that say they just need a problem solved. It's always going to be the freelancers job to educate them on what that is. If they say they want Wordpress but Rails is better for their needs, it's the consultants job to educate them.

I'll be taking all of this and updating the [Post a Project to Workshop form](http://letsworkshop.com/connect). It's free for a limited time, so if you're looking for a freelancer, now's a great time to find one!
