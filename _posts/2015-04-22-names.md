I get asked about how I named Workshop pretty often. The truth is I came up with the name Workshop before I had the idea for the service. Why? I thought it sounded cool.

Why did it sound cool? I don't know. Part gut-feeling. Part being easy to remember. The fun part was once I had the idea for the service and needed a name, I remembered it. 

It happened to work on multiple levels. A 'Workshop' is a place people go to manufacture goods. It's a place people go to work. People join my service to go to work also.

Also, people use it to shop for work, so like a tire-shop sells tires, I sell work.

That's one piece of advice I give people who are starting something new. Let the idea guide the name, and don't over think it.

If you're buying a domain before you've even really mapped out the idea, you're probably on the wrong track.
