People ask me how I started a paid newsletter. They ask enough to warrant me writing about it.

In November of 2013, I started a small private newsletter called Workshop. I charged subscribers $39/month to join â€“ and they got the best freelance jobs on the web neatly collected and sent to them every weekday. 

Here's how I started this subscription service:

1. I had a small (free) email list first. I launched to this list of about 200 people. I did other marketing, like writing blog posts, joint ventures, and more, but nothing mattered as much as when I emailed useful, value-filled articles to my mailing list. It printed me money.

2. I focused on making my subscribers better, not my newsletter. Most of my effort went to not just sending the best leads but also educating freelancers about how to contact and win work from these leads.

3. I started charging immediately. I launched to 1 paid subscriber. I spent 4 hours on launch day finding leads that were a perfect fit for my one subscriber. It was all worth it when he immediately replied to my email and said "holy shit, this is awesome." Launch. Now. Mailchimp exists, Campaign Monitor exists, Gumroad exists, Memberful exists. You exist. Now do it. That's all you need. Create a site in 10 minutes or less, link it to something where you can get paid (I recommend using Memberful and Campaign Monitor but you can basically duct tape anything together with Zapier). Improve as you go. 

If you get even 1 paid subscriber (like me) than you know people are willing to pay for your idea. If you don't, well at least you know that too.
