What's funny is that the way I've described the service has evolved over time. 

At Microconf this month, Ruben Gamez introduced me to a friend of his and when he heard me introduce Workshop as a "paid newsletter." He instantly remarked something that made me pause.

He said "I wouldn't call it a newsletter, when I hear paid newsletter I think of those financial reports people pay for."

"It's really a lead generation service for freelancers."

He was so right. I've been calling this thing a paid newsletter for over a year. Podcasts, interviews, blog posts, etc. All of this time I was choosing the wrong words to describe it. 

It took an off-handed comment from Ruben Gamez to realize it wasn't the right way to describe it.

Why was I using the wrong words? On my end I was delivering a paid newsletter. I used campaign monitor, so it had to be a newsletter. 

To my customers they were getting something else. They were getting their time back.
