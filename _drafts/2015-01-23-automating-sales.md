Using Patrick McKenzie's ideas in his email [Systematizing Sales With Software And Processes](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/sales_automation), I've been using the automation feature in [Drip](http://mbsy.co/drip/10089555) for Workshop and it's worked really well.

**When people sign up for a free sample of leads, they also get a follow up email:**

*Subject: how was the demo?*

This email always got a high reply rate (even without the links at the bottom) but now even people who don't have time to reply DO have time to click on one of those options. I don't keep track of the responses or do anything with the feedback. 

**Clicking on one of the options in the follow-up email triggers a one-off email to people that addresses their feedback:**

*Subject: RE: how was the demo?*

I've gotten a huge response rate to that second email, I think because it feels so real. I came up with the options after a year of collecting feedback, and realizing it almost always came down to those 4.
