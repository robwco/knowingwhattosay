Over the past year I've sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500+). This wouldn't be possible with some form of automation. 

The [long form sales page](http://letsworkshop.com) does a great job of anticipating and answering most questions you'll have about the service. Next, you can sign up for a free course which drips emails into your inbox that dissect the service from every angle.

But some people would rather just open up their inbox and type their question to me instead. Instead of expecting this to stop or wishing these tire-kickers would just go away, I decided to use a years worth of knowledge I had built up to answer their questions before they ask them.

Although the answers are already on [my FAQ](http://letsworkshop.com/advice) or Workshop page, nothing beats a caring thoughtful answer written directly for you from the creator of the service. I get that. I just didn't want to keep writing the same message over and over anymore.

But I also didn't want to lose the personal hand touch. 

Instead, I decided to automate the entire process. Someone could send in their question, and get an automated email back that I wrote. Sort of like a create your own adventure book. 

I was able to do this with Drip, using ideas from Patrick McKenzie's recent email: [Systematizing Sales With Software And Processes](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/sales_automation). 

I've been doing this using the [automation feature in Drip](http://mbsy.co/drip/10089555) and it's paid huge dividends for me so far. 

Here's what the process looks like:

**When people sign up for a free sample of leads, they also get a follow up email:**

*Subject: how was the demo?*

This email always got a high reply rate (even without the links at the bottom) but now even people who don't have time to reply DO have time to click on one of those options. I don't keep track of the responses or do anything with the feedback. 

**Clicking on one of the options in the follow-up email triggers a one-off email to people that addresses their feedback:**

*Subject: RE: how was the demo?*

I've gotten a huge response rate to that second email, I think because it feels so real. I came up with the options after a year of collecting feedback, and realizing it almost always came down to those 4.
