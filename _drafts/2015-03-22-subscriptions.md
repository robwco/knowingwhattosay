People ask me how I started a paid newsletter. They ask enough to warrant me writing about it.

In November of 2013, I started a small private newsletter called Workshop. I charged subscribers $39/month to join â€“ and they got the best freelance jobs on the web neatly collected and sent to them every weekday. 

Here's how I started this subscription service:

1) I had a small (free) email list first. I launched to this list of about 200 people. I did other marketing, like writing blog posts, joint ventures, and more, but nothing mattered as much as when I emailed useful, value-filled articles to my mailing list. It printed me money.

2) I focused on making my subscribers awesome, not my newsletter or subscription service. My first day I only had one customer. I spent a full 4 hours finding the best leads I could to speciically match the skills of my one customer and sent it to him (Kurt Elster). He immediately emailed me back saying - "holy shit this is awesome." I've tried to carry this through every day. It's not about you or your newsletter, it's about making the people who use your subscription better.

3) I started charging immediately. Like I said, I launched to 1 paid subscriber. I spent 4 hours finding leads that were perfect for this one guy. He immediately emailed me and was like "holy shit." Launch. Now. Mailchimp exists, campaign monitor exists, gumroad, or memberful exists. You exist. Now do it. That's all you fucking need. Create a site in 10 minutes or less, link it to something where you can get paid (I recommend using memberful and campaign monitor) or connect it all with Zapier and improve as you go. 

If you get even 1 paid subscriber then you know someone somewhere will pay for this thing you're creating. If you don't, well at least you know that too.
